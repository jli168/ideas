#### 2017 New Year's Resolution

##### 1. Write a simplified search service in Go, from backend to frontend
*  Create a micro service to crawl data from Craigslist 24/7, process & store the data, send it to Go's Elastic API to index.
Then provide a Restful API for third party.
*  Also create a tiny web service to consume the indexed data through the Restful API, and show search results on the web.
*  Finally, deploy the working code in DigitalOcean.
