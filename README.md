Ideas worth taking notes

#### What does this "ideas" repo's idea come from, and how to use it to record ideas?
*   Using github to manage and implement new ideas is very handy. You already work with github everyday, 
and you do not need another app to sync your ideas with your code. Take a look at [this idea repo](https://github.com/phodal/ideas)

*   `Readme` has a collections of ideas, each idea with a brief introduction. 

*   `Issues` is a great tool for tackle ideas. Create an issue, tag it with an idea, use it to set up steps to handle subtasks, 
take notes, add comments. Close it when it is done.
